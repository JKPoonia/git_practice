git practice # As of right now, I've coded some basic string methods in this repository. I'm currently working on methods for lists, dictionaries, sets, files, and letters on functions, among other things. Anyone who wants to contribute or use my code is welcome to do so; i'll be happy to assist you if you run into any issues. Keep up the wonderful job...
